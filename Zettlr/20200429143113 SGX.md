# Shortcomings
- Enclaves must communicate with IO devices through untrusted OS. It does not provide a trusted path to the user as the OS can change modify data that passes through. 
- Might leak attestation keys (which another processor might use to get any secrets provisioned to it) - [Foreshadow attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions#Spectre-like_attack). 

- To avoid a relay attack (where a secret key is reused) a proximity device (e.g., a usb key) can be used. The remote party would first establish a secure connection to the key which would create a TLS channel to the enclave
