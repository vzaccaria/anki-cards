# Secure enclave

- It is code that becomes part of the TCB, typically through remote attestation.
- It is characterized by an immutable committment of resources to one process such as hardware isolated address space
- Might receive secrets from outside or might send signed messages from them (untrusted OS can still relay these somewhere else)


# Secure monitor
- It is a software bridge between calls from the operating system and the enclave. 
- It is characterized by a physical memory protection (encryption)
- The security monitor must receive [[attestation]] from the [[silicon root of trust]]. In turn, it can provide attestation to enclaves.
