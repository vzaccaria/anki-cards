## Low* language
- Subset of F* that compiles to C through the Kremlin programming language
- Allows verification of 
    - [[20200424171311]] Memory safety 
    - functional correctness  
    - secret independence (against [[20200424171617]] Timing side channel attacks)

### HACL*
- Cryptographic library written in Low*
- Validated against timing side channel attacks

## Vale language
- Construct formally verified assembly language
- Initially produced Dafny code; now it is a subset of F*
- Generates VCs for SMT
- Uses a structured assembly format with if/then/else and while

### Komodo 
It is a monitor for a [[20200424180706]] Secure enclave (developed as an alternative to Intel SGX instructions or AMD SEV), running in the secure world of a processor. It has been specified and verified with VALE/Dafny. The specification is itself written in Dafny;

The following properties for the specification are proven (the implementation is verified to be compliant with the specification):

- enclave contents cannot be modified by anything else from that enclave
- enclave contents do not leak to other enclaves, the OS or other code or indirectly ([[20200424171617]] Timing side channel attacks).
- Requires separation (memory isolation) and secure control transfer mechanisms
- Specifies attestation
