** Groups
*** Group
   
   A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)][group]] is a monoid where for all elements $a$, the (*) operation satisfies:

   - *invertibility*: $a * a^{-1} = 1$.
   - *associativity*: $a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c$ 

   In a group, every element has its own inverse.

*** Subgroup  
   $H$ is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup][subgroup]] of $G$ if:

   - it is a subset of $G$ 
   - it forms a group under the operation (*).

   The *trivial subgroup* of any group is the subgroup ${e}$ consisting of just the identity element.

*** Coset 
    Given a subgroup $H$ and some $a$ in $G$, we define the *left coset* of $H$ as
    $aH = \{ah : h \in H\}$. We have some properties holding:

    - each $a$ generates a subset of $G$ and, considering all the elements $a$
      of $G$, the corresponding set of cosets of $H$ is a partition of $G$.

    - all cosets of $H$ have the same amount of elements (which is the same number of elements of $H$). 

    - because the family of cosets is a partition, the size of $G$ is a multiple of $H$ and its cosets.
