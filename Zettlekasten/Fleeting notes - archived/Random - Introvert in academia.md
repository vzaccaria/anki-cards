## Tips

- Instead of joining a million different clubs, pick a few you’re genuinely interested. Be active, participate, and make an effort to get to know the members outside of the club’s events.
- Social skill is a learnable skill
- You have to put yourself in an environment that forces you to change.. improv classes? Small talk?
- Find a mentor? It is possible at this stage?
- Conferences are a substrate for new thoughts
- When I’m on campus, most of my job is connecting, and a door is too strong a signal.
