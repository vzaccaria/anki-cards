# Embrace embarrassment. 
- Feeling foolish is part of the path to achieving something important, something meaningful. The more a major life decision scares you, chances are the more you need to be doing it.

- Before you are able to be good at something and do something important, you must first suck at something and have no clue what you’re doing.

- Ergo, due to the [transitive property of awesomeness](https://markmanson.net/meta-awesomeness), if you avoid anything that could potentially embarrass you, then you will never end up doing something that feels important.

- “My [parents would hate it](https://markmanson.net/risk),” or “My friends would make fun of me,” or “If I failed, I’d look like an idiot,” then chances are, you’re actually avoiding something you truly care

# Fulfillment
- If You Had to Leave the House All Day, Every Day, Where Would You Go and What Would You Do?
- What most people don’t understand is that passion is the [result of action](https://markmanson.net/how-to-get-motivated/), not the cause of it.

# What would you do if
- If You Knew You Were Going to Die One Year From Today, What Would You Do and How Would You Want to Be Remembered
- When people feel like they have no sense of direction, no purpose in their life, it’s because they don’t know what’s important to them, **they don’t know what their values are.**
- one or two things that are bigger than yourself, and bigger than those around you, values that will determine your priorities and guide your actions.
