* Katalin Kariko ha lavorato per 20 anni senza riconoscimenti, è stata persino demansionata perché non riusciva a farsi finanziare (l'mRNA non è stato mai finanziato)
* Quanti ce ne sono come lei? Quanto la politica del "finanzia la persona e non l'idea" ne ha esclusi dalla ricerca? Quanto è vero che ad oggi si finanziano le idee? e soprattutto, quanto viene dedicato al finanziare idee non popolari, oscure?

### Raw notes
- [Katalin Karikó](https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/) is the now-celebrated scientist who, along with a colleague, published a [key paper in 2005](https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(05)00211-6) on messenger RNA.

- But Karikó wasn’t always celebrated. Far from it.
- She was demoted in 1995 because, n**o matter how many times she applied for NIH funding for her mRNA research**, she never got a grant for it.
- It is a **miracle that Karikó stuck in academia for so long after being treated this way.**
* That’s why we should worry about the **invisible Karikós**: the people with good ideas that weren’t popular at the time who dropped out of academia. It’s unlikely that **she was the only person** in the world who had an interesting idea in 1985 that could have turned into a groundbreaking discovery over the next few decades.

* We’ll never know what we missed.
* That makes me think about the “**fund the person, not the project**” approach.
* Anyone can identify Karikó in retrospect, given her persistence and her eventual discoveries. But what do we do _right now_ to find the 2022 versions of Karikó who simply don’t (yet) look like the “visionaries” or “geniuses” who would be eligible for “person not project” funding?
* Bend over backward to **fund a more diverse range of people and ideas**, even deliberately including ideas that are currently perceived as unpopular, unworkable, obscure, and the like.
