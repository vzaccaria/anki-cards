- don’t make it a status update
	- Instead, give me status updates in slack, on a regular basis.
		- **It keeps you and your project top of mind throughout the month.**
		- **A month is too long to go without a status update.**
		- **It’s an opportunity to make yourself look good**

* your monthly 1:1 is one of the few opportunities you have to meet with your manager without someone else’s itinerary dictating the conversation.
* Try to answer these
	* Is there something bothering you? **If something is bothering you, tell me.** I can’t do anything about it if I don’t know about it. Some people are worried about coming across as negative, or feeling like they’re complaining too much.
	* If you’re trying to set yourself up for your next step in your career, obviously, tell me that too. But, the best advice I can offer you in this situation is to ask me what _my_ problems are, and how you can help me solve them.
	* Almost by definition, my problems are at a different tier of responsibility than yours. **By asking about, and offering to help with those problems, you are a) getting exposed to a different facet of the business than you usually would, and b) getting practice dealing with things that will form the foundation of your next role**.
	* The last few minutes of the call should be a round-up of all the action items that have been discussed. Clearly state:

		-   **Who** is going to do it,
		-   **what** is going to be done,
		-   and **when** it’s going to be done by.
