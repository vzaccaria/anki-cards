- how to respond in a way that was professional, helpful, and fair to this student
- Course evaluations were found to be affected by perceptions of faculty e-mail helpfulness and promptness
- Professor-student e-mail, therefore, is likely a student’s first exposure to professional e-mail. Thus, students need instruction and modeling on professional e-mail etiquette
- The first factor is the _asynchronous_ nature of e-mail. Because e-mail is a one-way form of communication, instructors  cannot help students modify their message through comments or nonverbal cues. 

- These components of verbal interaction typically prevent students from going too far with self-disclosure or provide them with feedback that they should wrap up their comments.

- The second factor is _depersonalization_. E-mail does not require a student to see the instructor, so the typical face-to-face social interaction norms are suspended. Without norms to rely upon, students may write from within their stream of consciousness, in which words are not carefully considered
* Asynchrony and depersonalization are compounded by a third factor, which is the _immediacy_ upon which a message is sent. An e-mail can be sent within seconds of a student becoming frustrated. Communicating while emotions are running high tends to make these messages less thoughtful, so they’re more likely to come across as rude and demanding
* We have all received these e-mails. So how should we address these types of communications? Here is a brief list of strategies for managing e-mail communications with students and some example responses.

   - **_Direct Instruction_:** We should include formal instruction on the characteristics of a professional e-mail in our courses. Such instruction could include showing students professional and unprofessional examples of the same e-mail communication as well as outlining requirements for e-mails to the professor, such as a requirement that first and last names should be included in any e-mail.
   - **_Model Professionalism_:** Consider student-instructor e-mail an opportunity for students to learn proper communication techniques and for you to model professional e-mail etiquette.
   - **_Encourage Student Ownership_:** Instead of giving students the answers to their questions, tell them where they can go to find the answers to their questions.

	_The assignment due dates are on the syllabus. Our Blackboard site contains the study guide for the test. Please review both of these. If it is not on the study guide, then it will not be on the test._

	**_Professors Have Finite Capacity_:** Let students know when they can expect feedback and why the professor is unable to give the feedback in a quicker manner. Placing such limitations on the syllabus can also be helpful.
	**_Refer Out_:** This approach is typically used when the issues have risen to a university level and can no longer be handled at the classroom level.

_The University has a process by which students can request a withdrawal from courses due to extenuating circumstances after the drop period has ended. You can find the policy and the forms for submitting such a request at the link below._

**_Refer To The Syllabus_:** This approach is very useful because relying on policy is often an easy defense for instructors.

_Please re-read the course policy on attendance in the syllabus._

**_Take a Short Pause_:** By taking a deep breath and delaying a response for an hour or more, instructors can answer a message in a more objective matter and avoid escalating an issue.

**_They Will Ask Twice_:** While we do not advocate ignoring an e-mail outright as a matter of course, there are those rare times when no response is actually the best response. Some time might motivate students to address the issue on their own. If you receive a second e-mail, then you must respond.
