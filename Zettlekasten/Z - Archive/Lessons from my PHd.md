### Lead or be led
Don't expect people to ask you what you want to work on. You should already be telling them.

*Show up with a plan.*

### Topic sentences
Write the first sentence of every paragraph you intend on having. Don't write the paragraph bodies yet!

Do those sentences convey what you wanted? Do they flow together? Are you missing any major details? I often have to iterate on these a few times

Keep these topic sentences around. In fact, I was taught to bold them. My PhD advisor used a LaTeX macro so they can be turned on and off.

Whenever you or a collaborator needs to skim the writing, they just need to read these bolded topic sentences to understand the story.

### Unmotivated details
Before you explain something, you probably need to motivate it. Why should this person care about what I'm going to tell them? It often only takes a few words to do so.

### Slides versus speaker
There are two main modes of presenting: the speaker leads and the slides assist OR the slide leads and the speaker assists.

**Speaker leads:** You want the attention to be on what you are saying. The slide exists to assist your message by showing a short form of what you are saying aloud. The slide should be very simple.

**Slide leads:** You have a figure or table that you want the audience to understand. The speaker is there to help guide their attention.

You can't have both at once though! If I am trying to understand a graph, then I can't be listening to you, and vice versa.

A few more recommendations:

-   What you are saying should go with what is on the slide.
-   Always motivate what you are telling the audience. Unmotivated details will end anyone's attention.
-   Explain the axes of a graph.
-   If you have a complex figure, highlight where you want people to look or gray out where you don't want them to look.
-   You don't have to write full sentences on slides.
-   One idea per slide.
-   Slow down.

### Meetings
When I first started working with my PhD advisor, I thought our weekly meeting was for me to _prove_ to him that I had been productive.

**"advisors are input/output machines"**. You put into it your update and you get back feedback. The meeting is for _your_ benefit.

A few suggestions for running update meetings with your advisor/manager:

-   Assume they forgot everything that was said last meeting.
-   Show up with things to talk about and a goal.
-   In 3-4 sentences, refresh everyone's memory about the last meeting and what you were supposed to accomplish since then.
-   In 4-6 sentences, summarize what you did, what worked, what didn't work, and what you think you should do next. Think of this as bullet points.
-   Avoid diving into details until you know everyone is on the same page and caught up.
-   If possible, show up with something tangible, like a visual aid, a demo, a draft, or at least some notes.
