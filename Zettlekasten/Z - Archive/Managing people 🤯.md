- Your job is _not to manage people_, _manage processes_ and _lead people_ 
- You manage processes on how you expect work to be done, where each person's authority starts and ends, how their careers are made, and how all this can be discussed, and/or changed
- Additionally, you are leading people by example and through empathy.
    -   They have goals, fears and motivations. Frequently also problems outside of work.
    -   Act how you would want them to act if the role would be reversed.

-   _Processes are expectations made explicit_
    -   They can be as simple as "every morning we all do X to ensure everyone else is unblocked."

* In every discussion/project/problem/situation, it needs to be clear who makes decisions, Ideally, the person who will afterward do (or lead) the follow-up work makes the decisions.
* Trust them and let them make mistakes (within damage barriers)
* The worst thing that can happen is that you frequently step in, and people disassociate from their work. They become drones who do what's told instead of taking ownership.

#### Avoid drive-by management
* Don't start throwing your opinion or ideas around in meetings
    -   You most likely lack context, and most likely, you won't be the person needing to follow through
    - Use [fyi tags](https://klinger.io/posts/fyi-how-founders-can-avoid-drive-by-management) in async communication that usually lacks the "nuance" of voice

> **#f yi:** something interesting. An article and podcast, etc. I thought you might like it. But if not no worries. Nothing to see here.
> 
> **# suggestion:** a passing thought. I sometimes have good ideas. You might like to hear good ideas. If I’m in your shoes, i consider it. but I’m not in your shoes so do what you’d like. A friendly response if you don’t go with the suggestion is nice, so i make better suggestions over time, but is by no means necessary.
> 
> **# recommendation:** I’ve thought a lot about this. Perhaps even lost sleep. I’ve invested deeply. I think this is a good plan. You can still disagree and go a different direction, but walking me through why you are doing this is kindly requested.
> 
> **# plea:** We don’t have a lot of mandates at Zapier, but this is one. Please do this. If you disagree enough that you can’t go along with it, we should both reconsider our roles here. It’s that important.

> i use # fyi and # suggestions **all the time**. # recommendation **much less** so. and # plea is almost **entirely unused**.
